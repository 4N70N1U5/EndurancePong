# EndurancePong

My very first PyGame project. A very simple, single player, Pong-style game made in a single day.

The goal of the game is to last as many turns as possible against the computer, who can't lose, as the game gets incrementally more difficult.

To play, install Python 3 and PyGame and run main.py.
